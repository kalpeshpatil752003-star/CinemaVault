1. Project Overview
CinemaVault is a front-end movie discovery platform that allows users to browse a curated collection of films, view detailed information (including synopses, cast, and trailers), and read community reviews. The project is designed for high performance using ES Modules and a static data-driven approach.

2. Technical Stack
Language: JavaScript (Converted from TypeScript for browser compatibility).

Architecture: Modular Scripting (ESM).

Data Format: Object-Oriented Arrays.

Styling: CSS3 Variable-based theming (referenced in logic).

data.js
This is the Core Database of the application. It acts as a local API.

Movie Objects: Contains 30+ unique entries starting from id: "1" (Inglourious Basterds) through the Fantasy Sagas ending at id: "30" (The Golden Compass).

Schema:

id: Unique string identifier.

title/year/director: Basic metadata.

genres: Array of categories used for filtering.

poster: URL string for visual rendering.

trailer: YouTube embed URL.

reviews: An array of Review objects containing author, rating, and comment.

detail.js
This file contains the Dynamic Rendering Engine for the movie detail pages.

URL Parsing: Uses URLSearchParams to detect the ?id= parameter from the web address.

Dynamic Injection:

renderMovieDetail(): Targets the #movieDetail DOM element to inject HTML templates for the movie's specific data.

renderReviews(): Iterates through the movie's review array to build the comment section.

Star Logic: generateStars() converts numerical ratings (e.g., 4.5) into visual star icons (★).

4. Feature Highlights
The Fantasy Collection (IDs 13–30)
The database features a dedicated "Epic Fantasy" expansion, where every part of major trilogies and sagas is stored as a separate entity:

The Lord of the Rings: 3 separate entries (Fellowship, Two Towers, Return of the King).

Harry Potter: 8 separate entries covering the full decade of films.

Fantastic Beasts: 3 separate entries.

Narnia: The complete Walden Media trilogy.

Mock Review System
Every movie is equipped with at least one high-quality mock review to demonstrate the UI's capability to handle:

User Sentiments: Short and long-form feedback.

Time-stamping: All reviews include a date string for chronological display.

Unique Authors: Simulated community engagement.


5. Database Schema (data.js)
To keep the site running smoothly, every movie entry must follow this JavaScript object structure

Property,Type,Description
id,String,"Must be unique (e.g., ""1"", ""2"", ""13"")."
title,String,The full name of the movie.
poster,String,A full URL to an image (JPG/PNG).
genres,Array,"A list of categories like [""Fantasy"", ""Action""]."
trailer,String,"A YouTube embed link (e.g., https://www.youtube.com/embed/ID)."
reviews,Array,"A collection of objects containing author, rating, comment, and date."

6. Maintenance Guide
Adding a New Movie
Open data.js.

Add a new object to the movies array.

Ensure the id follows the next increment (e.g., "31").

Verify the trailer link is in the https://www.youtube.com/embed/[ID] format to avoid iframe blocking.

Editing a Poster
Locate the movie by its title or id and update the poster string with a new URL from a reliable image host (like Amazon M-Media or IMDB).
